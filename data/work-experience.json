      "During my position as Digital Designer at networx Recruitment, I was responsible for following a number of our clients' branding guidelines while building their recruitment system, such as their careers page both custom and template, job adverts, onboarding sites and candidate experience branding. During my time there I also helped run Housing Jobs' social media pages, set up social media apps for clients' twitter and facebook pages and assist with updates to a previous version of our recruitment software website.",
      "A major development I did at my position at networx Recruitment is to allow the clients onboarding sites to work on multiple devices, allowing candidates to access their onboarding information and documents from any device. This was done using one stylesheet for over 40 different onboarding sites.",
      "During my time at Networx, I used Adobe Creative Cloud on a daily basis to create mockups, assets, prototypes, illustrations and documents as well as using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript/jQuery as a part of the building process for career sites, onboarding sites and candidate experience."
